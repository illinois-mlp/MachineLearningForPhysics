# <span style="color: blue;"><b>Bayesian Statistics I</b></span>

## *Overview*
You will learn the basics of statistics, particularly Bayesian Statistics. Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. Bayesian statistics is a statistical theory that uses probability to represent a degree of belief in an event. It's based on Bayes' theorem, which updates a model's parameters with data to make predictions.
