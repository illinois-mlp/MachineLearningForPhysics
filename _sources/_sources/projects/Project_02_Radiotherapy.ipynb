    "In November 1895, Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen accidentally discovered X-rays while fiddling with cathode ray tubes.

    "Today, radiation therapy involves firing intense beams of ionizing radiation to obliterate cancer cell DNA and halt the malicious growth of tumors. A patient is often laid before a gantry, essentially a LINAC accelerator, that ejects X-rays (or protons, when further precision is required). A rigorous treatment plan requires consideration of:  \n",
