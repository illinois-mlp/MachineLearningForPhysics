    "In November 1895, Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen accidentally discovered X-rays while fiddling with cathode ray tubes. He proceeded to pass these rays through his wife's hand to create the world's first X-ray image. This was a pivotal time for the field of medical physics (and their marriage): a means to harness physics phenomena to better the human condition.\n",

    "Today, radiation therapy involves firing intense beams of ionizing radiation to obliterate cancer cell DNA and halt the malicious growth of tumors. A patient is often laid before a gantry, essentially a LINAC accelerator, that ejects X-rays (or protons, when further precision is required). A rigorous treatment plan requires consideration of:  \n",

The machine learning methods we've studied thus far have been instrumental in better resolving this combinatorial problem\n",
